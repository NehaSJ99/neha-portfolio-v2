    comment: 'I had a great experience working with Neha. She is a talented and capable coder. Definitely a self-starter. The project started with limited direction but she took off churning through several new technologies and APIs, picking up on her own, including backend services, containerization, devops and frontend GUI. She not only demonstrated she is a full-stack capable, she also demonstrated rich visual asthetic and awareness. She worked well in our team. She is an inqusitive and thoughtful problem solver and a pleasure to work with. You\'d be silly not to hire her.',
